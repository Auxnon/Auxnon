## My most notable projects right now...

### [Petrichor64](https://github.com/Auxnon/Petrichor64)
The open sourced runtime for the Rust-built wgpu-based game engine. Cross-platform and works with multiple graphics APIs. Currently being ported for embedded web usage via WebGPU. This is an all-in-one runtime is currently limited to editing code in an external editor. In-engine CLI can bundle game directories into "carts" contained as binary data injected onto a png image. Think of it as Pico8 for the Playstation 1. The release build with some additional developer niceties is currently closed source. It can be downloaded on [Itch.io](https://makeavoy.itch.io/petrichor64)

### [Silt-Lua](https://github.com/Auxnon/silt-lua)
A Rust-built Lua superset interpreter and runtime. Currently stack-based with opinionated bytecode representation and optional syntactic sugar hidden behind feature flags. Intended for use by Petrichor64.

A monolithic repo containing Version 3 of [MakeAvoy.com](https://makeavoy.com/), [Petrichor64.app](https://petrichor64.app/), and the Rust-built axum/tower backend
